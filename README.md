# Honkai: Star Rail - Data Scanner
Easily export light cones, relics, and character data from Honkai: Star Rail to JSON format using OCR.

## TODO
- [ ] Train new OCR model. Current pre-trained model fails for single digit numbers and decimals.
- [ ] Async doesn't execute as expected. Possibly need to create separate thread for OCR.
- [ ] Filter min level/rarity
